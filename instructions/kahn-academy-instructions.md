## Project Demos
Whenever you finish a project, we will have a one-on-one demo where you show me your project. This has many benefits. As a software developer, you will constantly demo your work to others in your project or organization so this is good practice for that. Most importantly I can see how you structured your code and how much effort you put into the project. It also gives you an opportunity to ask questions and get feedback.

Once you finish a project, one at a time, bring your laptop up to my desk for a demo! If someone else is alraeady deomoing, keep working until I'm available. If my desk doesn't work I can come to you.
