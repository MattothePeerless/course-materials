# How to figure things out

While going through the instructions and excercises I'm sure you'll get stuck and have questions. 
That is a good thing! Getting stuck is your brains way of telling you that it needs you to figure something out. 
And you learn the most when you figure it out for yourself. 

So please follow these steps whenever you get stuck or have a question:

1. Google it! Googling for anwswers is an essential skill for all human beings on this planet but especially programmers. You should spend at least 1 - 2 minutes trying to figure it out before asking others for help. If I catch you not googling for things I'm going to troll you with http://lmgtfy.com/.
2. Post it in the skype chat. 
3. If no one responds in the skype chat, ask me!. If we are in class, raise your hand and I'll come to you. If we're not in class, send me an email (nick@griffinschool.com) describing your situation and I'll respond whenever I can.
