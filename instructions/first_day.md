# Welcome to your first day

Welcome to **Introduction to Programming** at Griffin! First things, first. Let's get to know each other a little better. Go around the room and introduce yourself. Please say:
* Your name
* Your grade level

Ok, now I'm going to tell you all more about this class.

# Lets get started! 
## Setup Skype
Your first challenge ;) is to install Skype on your computer. If you already have skype installed, you may want to create a separate user for this class. Up to you. 

My skype name is **griffincoding**. Once you sign in, add me as a contact and I will add you to the class chat. Once you are added to the class chat, say "Hello"!.

I'll post futher instructions in the chat when everyone is in.
