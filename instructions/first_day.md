# Welcome to your first day

Welcome to **Introduction to Programming** at Griffin! First things, first. Let's get to know each other a little better. Go around the room and introduce yourself. Please say:
* Your name
* Your grade level
* Previous programming experience or interests

Ok, now I'm going to tell you all more about this class.

# Lets get started!
In the software industry, every company uses some kind of chat to communicate with each other. Chat's are very usefull as a place to ask and answer questions, and they also cut down on interuption. Sending someone a message is way better than interupting them in person.

We'll be using Skype in this class.

## Setup Skype
Your first challenge ;) is to install [Skype](http://www.skype.com) on your computer. If you already have skype installed, you may want to create a separate user for this class. Up to you. 

My skype name is **griffincoding**. Once you sign in, add me as a contact and I will add you to the class chat. Once you are added to the class chat, say "Hello"!.

I'll post futher instructions in the chat when everyone is in.

While you are waiting, read [this](./figure-it-out.md)
