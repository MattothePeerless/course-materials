# Welcome to your first day

Welcome to **Introduction to Programming** at Griffin! Programming is one of the most valuable skills you can learn today. Using the latest tools, you will learn to code in an exciting and interactive environment. This class is designed for beginner programmers but is flexible to accommodate more advanced students. We will focus on practical learning where you will develop computational thinking, write and debug code, work with modern development tools, and learn the best practices to achieve concrete results. Whether you want to build the next billion user app or you just want to learn what coding is all about, you will develop the foundation needed to build every technology you use today.

First things, first. Let's get to know each other a little better. Go around the room and introduce yourself. Please say:
* Your name
* Your grade level
* Previous programming experience

Ok, now I'm going to tell you all more about this class.

# Lets get started! 
## Setup Skype
Your first challenge ;) is to install Skype on your computer. If you already have skype installed, you may want to create a separate user for this class. Up to you. 

My skype name is **griffincoding**. Once you sign in, add me as a contact and I will add you to the class chat. Once you are added to the class chat, say "Hello"!.

I'll post a link to the first exercise in the chat when everyone is in.
