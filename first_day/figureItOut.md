# How to figure things out

While going through the excercises I'm sure you'll get stuck and have questions. 
That is a good thing! Getting stuck is your brains way of telling you that it needs you to figure something out. 
And you learn the most when you figure it out for yourself. 

So please follow these steps whenever you get stuck or have a question:
1. Google it! Googling for anwswers is an essential skill for all human beings on this planet but especially programmers
2. Post it in the skype chat. 
3. Raise your hand and I'll come to you.
