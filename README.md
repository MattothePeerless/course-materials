![Two states of every programmer](https://devhumor.com/content/uploads//images/October2014/states-of-a-programmer.png)

Welcome to coding at Griffin School! Programming is one of the most valuable skills you can learn today. Using the latest tools, you will learn to code in an exciting and interactive environment. This class is designed for beginner programmers but is flexible to accommodate more advanced students. We will focus on practical learning where you will develop computational thinking, write and debug code, work with modern development tools, and learn the best practices to achieve concrete results. Whether you want to build the next billion user app or you just want to learn what coding is all about, you will develop the foundation needed to build every technology you use today.

This repo will hold the course materials we will use throughout the year.
