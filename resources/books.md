# Books
Online learning resources are a great way to interactively learn to code. But often they don't go very deep in a subject. There are many great and classic books that dive deep and can take you to the next level. Keep in mind that most tech books get out of date very quickly, so look for an edition published within the last year or two.

This page will be used to enumerate the books every software engineer should know about.

## Free Books
