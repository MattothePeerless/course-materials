## Course Synopsis
Students will teach themselves to code using online courses and other resources. We live in an incredible time where anyone can teach themselves to code online for free.
As the teacher, I am here to mentor students through the learning process and to introduce them to new resources and ideas. 
Students will learn the basics of coding using Kahn Academy in the context of front-end web programming because 
code can be run directy in the browser, the results of programs have an immediate visual result, and the same fundamentals apply the front-end and back-end.
Students must complete several required online courses, several  elective online courses, and create their own webpage.
