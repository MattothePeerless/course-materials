## Course Synopsis
Students will teach themselves to code using online courses and other resources. We live in an incredible time where anyone can teach themselves to code online.
As the teacher, I am here to mentor students through the learning process and to introduce them to new resources and ideas. 

Students will learn the basics of coding using Kahn Academy in the context of front-end web programming because 
code can be run directy in the browser, the results of programs have an immediate visual result, and the same fundamentals apply the front-end and back-end.
Students must complete several required online courses, several  elective online courses, and create their own webpage.

### Student Success
This class is designed to accomidate beginner and advanced students. If you are beginner and you work hard but don't make it all the way through the electives, that's ok. If you are an advanced student and can get through all of the courses quickly, you are expected to move on to complete more electives. Go through these courses at your own pace. Grading is largely based on effort, as long as you work hard and put in effort you'll do great and learn a lot.
